Every Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern / UTC-4, the LBRY Foundation sponsors the LBRY Foundation Podcast, an event hosted on the Discord server to talk about new developments in the community, the Foundation-recognized Creator of the Week, another news and events relevant to the LBRY community.

Each Podcast is a recorded record of the entertaining madness that ensued.

Notes, content of interest to the community at large, and special events will also be posted to this Channel.

The current maintainer is
Lex Tenebris
